# Library Management System

## Overview
This is a **Library Management System** built using **C++** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**. The system helps in managing library operations such as book issuance, returns, and member management efficiently.

## Features
- Add, delete, and update book records
- Manage library members and their borrowing history
- Search books by title, author, or ID
- Implemented using DSA techniques for efficiency
- Console-based interface for user interactions

## Technologies Used
- **C++** for application development
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** for efficient operations (Linked Lists, Trees, Hash Tables, etc.)

## Installation
1. Download or clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd library-management-system
   ```
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
   ```sh
   g++ main.cpp -o library_management
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./library_management
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the program in a terminal.
2. Use the menu-driven interface to navigate through the system.
3. Add or remove books and manage member records.
4. Search for books and issue/return them accordingly.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a GUI for better user experience
- Add a database for persistent storage
- Introduce user authentication and roles
